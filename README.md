# Machine-Learning---Credit-Fraud-Detection

Credit card fraud is a wide-ranging term for theft and fraud committed using or involving a payment card,
such as a credit card or debit card, as a fraudulent source of funds in a transaction.
The purpose may be to obtain goods without paying or to obtain unauthorized funds from an account.
Credit card fraud is also an adjunct to identity theft.
According to the United StatesFederal Trade Commission,
while the rate of identity theft had been holding steady during the mid-2000s, it rose by 21 percent in 2008.
However, credit card fraud, that crime which most people associate with ID theft,
decreased as a percentage of all ID theft complaints for the sixth year in a row.


Using machine learning to detect financial fraud dates back to the early 1990s and has advanced over the years.
Researchers train models to extract behavioral patterns from past transactions, called “features,” that signal fraud.
When you swipe your card, the card pings the model and, if the features match fraud behavior, the sale gets blocked.

This Machine Learning project utilizes various of advanced Machine Learning Libraries (such as TensorFlow, Skitlearn, Karnas, 
etc.) in order to detect the credit card frauds.
